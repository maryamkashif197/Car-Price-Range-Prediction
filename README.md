Car Price Range machine learning project
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis on Car Price Range Prediction dataset using Python
•	Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality
•	Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and regressor, Naive Bayes classifier, and Decision Trees classifier for car price range prediction
•	Evaluated model performances using accuracy, mean square error (MSE), confusion matrix, recall, and precision
