Data science project 1
Thyroid Insight: Data Exploration, Preparation, & PCA analysis 
•	Conducted through exploring a Thyroid dataset, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation and analysis techniques. 
•	Preparing the dataset included displaying dataset information, filtering and transforming data, handling missing values, and visualizing relationships through plots such as boxplots, histograms, scatterplots. 
•	Dimensionality reduction was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for insight into significant variance within the data.


Data science project 2
Car Price Range machine learning project
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis on Car Price Range Prediction dataset using Python
•	Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality
•	Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and regressor, Naive Bayes classifier, and Decision Trees classifier for car price range prediction
•	Evaluated model performances using accuracy, mean square error (MSE), confusion matrix, recall, and precision
